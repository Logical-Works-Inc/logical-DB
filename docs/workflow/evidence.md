Sections 5–6 of [WORKFLOW.md](../../WORKFLOW.md), moved verbatim under the
120-line document law.

## 5. Compounding, buildable, surgical

**Compounding.** Every unit, trait, or module added makes future tasks easier.
New capabilities plug in through existing traits without rewriting call sites. If
adding a feature requires rewriting half the repo, the previous architecture was
anti-compounding debt.

**Always buildable.** Every single commit compiles and passes tests. Never
commit a broken intermediate state intending to fix it in the next step. If a
refactor breaks the build for more than twenty minutes, the change radius is too
broad.

**Surgical change radius.**

- Touch only the lines the invariant requires. No gratuitous mass renames, no
  cosmetic formatting rewrites, no sweeping module migrations in the same turn
  as a semantic fix.
- Identify before touching: map callers and downstream consumers first. One
  CodeGraph query replaces five grep chains.
- Parallel seams over in-place demolition when replacing a subsystem: introduce
  the new implementation alongside the old, point callers at it one at a time,
  verify tests, then delete the old code.

Time-box is thirty minutes by default. Not terminal within the box: stop, report
the SHA and the receipt, await direction. Identical-state retry is forbidden.

## 6. Evidence proportionality

| Change | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Product runtime | full nine-axis SLO matrix, measured per axis |
| Config, docs, CI, README, scripts | one line of receipt per file |
| Instruction or config loading | config-loading evidence only |

**The nine axes.** Frontier (design beats credible alternatives), Hyperscale
(>1M concurrent, correct), Idiomatic (ownership, errors, lifetimes sound),
Generalized (works across declared inputs), Decoupled (components independently
replaceable), Ephemeral (survives process loss), Portable (same semantics on all
targets), Multi-tenant (isolated under concurrent use), Performance (fastest
correct implementation).

Every claim carries evidence: command, exit code, result, artifact ID. Before
completion, account for every requirement, every failed check, and every
unknown. No hidden exclusions.

AI and model output is untrusted first-party evidence until independently
verified. Every capability claim separately states which of these it is:
**planned**; **present in code at an exact commit**; **exercised on the exact
claimed path**; **independently evidenced**; **safe to rely on or merge**. Never
collapse these into "done".
